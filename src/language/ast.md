Building an abstract syntax tree (AST) for a programming language involves several steps, including tokenizing, parsing, and constructing the tree. Here's a general outline for building an AST:

- Choose a programming language: Select the programming language for which you want to create an AST. Familiarize yourself with the language's syntax and semantics.

- Define the grammar: Define the grammar rules for the programming language. Typically, you would use a formal grammar notation like Backus-Naur Form (BNF) or Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) to express the structure of your language's syntax.

- Tokenize the input: Tokenization is the process of breaking the input source code into smaller pieces, called tokens. Each token represents a syntactic element of the programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, and punctuation marks. You can use a lexer (or scanner) to perform this task. There are tools like Flex, ANTLR, or Lex that can help you generate a lexer from your grammar rules.

- Implement a parser: The parser is responsible for taking the tokens produced by the lexer and organizing them into an AST according to the grammar rules. There are two main types of parsers: top-down (recursive descent) and bottom-up (such as LALR or LR). There are parser generator tools like Bison, ANTLR, or Yacc that can help you create a parser based on your grammar.

- Define the AST nodes: Define the classes or data structures that represent the nodes in the AST. Each node type should correspond to a construct in your programming language (e.g., function declarations, variable assignments, loops, conditionals, etc.). Nodes should store relevant information, like the token's value, location, or children nodes.

- Build the AST: Modify the parser so that, when it recognizes a grammar rule, it creates a corresponding AST node and links it to its parent and/or children nodes. The parser should return the root node of the AST after successfully parsing the input source code.

- (Optional) Implement a visitor pattern: To traverse the AST and perform operations on its nodes (e.g., code generation, analysis, or optimization), you can implement a visitor pattern. This pattern allows you to separate the logic for different operations and make your AST handling code more modular and extensible.

- Test and debug: Test your lexer, parser, and AST construction with various inputs. This will help you identify any issues with the grammar rules, parser implementation, or AST node definitions.

Remember that this is a high-level overview of the process. Specific implementation details will depend on the programming language you're working with and the tools you choose.


# BNF

Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation used to describe the syntax of programming languages, context-free grammars, and other formal systems. It was invented by John Backus and Peter Naur in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a way to define the syntax of the ALGOL 60 programming language. BNF is widely used in language design, compiler development, and documentation.

BNF uses a set of production rules to define the structure and composition of valid strings in a language. Each production rule specifies how a non-terminal symbol can be replaced by a sequence of terminal and/or non-terminal symbols. Terminal symbols represent the basic elements of the language, such as keywords, identifiers, and literals, while non-terminal symbols represent higher-level constructs that can be further expanded.

A BNF grammar consists of:

    A start symbol: The starting point for generating strings in the language.
    A set of non-terminal symbols: These symbols represent higher-level constructs that can be expanded further.
    A set of terminal symbols: These symbols represent the basic elements of the language and cannot be expanded further.
    A set of production rules: These rules specify how non-terminal symbols can be replaced with sequences of terminal and non-terminal symbols.

BNF notation uses the following conventions:

    Non-terminal symbols are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <expression>).
    Terminal symbols are typically written as plain text or enclosed in quotes (e.g., "if" or +).
    The ::= symbol is used to separate the left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal symbol from the right-hand side (RHS) replacement sequence in a production rule.
    The | symbol is used to denote alternatives for the RHS of a production rule.

Here's an example of a simple BNF grammar for arithmetic expressions involving addition and multiplication:

``` go
<expression> ::= <term> | <expression> "+" <term>
<term>       ::= <factor> | <term> "*" <factor>
<factor>     ::= <number> | "(" <expression> ")"
<number>     ::= <digit> | <number> <digit>
<digit>      ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
```

In this example, the grammar describes how expressions can be built from terms and factors combined with addition (+) and multiplication (*) operators. Parentheses are used to group sub-expressions, and numbers are built from digits.




The Progress ABL (Advanced Business Language) is a large and complex language, and providing a complete BNF grammar for it would be beyond the scope of this response. However, I can provide a simplified BNF grammar for some basic constructs in the Progress ABL language to give you an idea of how it might look.

Please note that this is a minimal and non-exhaustive example, focusing only on a small subset of the language constructs, and not accounting for every possible syntax and feature of Progress ABL.

``` php

<abl-program> ::= <statement-list>

<statement-list> ::= <statement> | <statement-list> <statement>

<statement> ::= <block> | <assignment-statement> | <if-statement> | <repeat-statement> | <for-statement>

<block> ::= "DO" <statement-list> "END."

<assignment-statement> ::= <identifier> "=" <expression> "."

<if-statement> ::= "IF" <condition> "THEN" <statement-list> <else-block> "END."

<else-block> ::= "ELSE" <statement-list> | Îµ

<repeat-statement> ::= "REPEAT" <statement-list> "UNTIL" <condition> "."

<for-statement> ::= "FOR" <identifier> "=" <expression> "TO" <expression> "DO" <statement-list> "END."

<condition> ::= <expression> <comparison-operator> <expression>

<expression> ::= <term> | <expression> <additive-operator> <term>

<term> ::= <factor> | <term> <multiplicative-operator> <factor>

<factor> ::= <identifier> | <number> | <string> | "(" <expression> ")"

<identifier> ::= (a valid Progress ABL identifier)

<number> ::= (a valid numeric literal)

<string> ::= (a valid string literal)

<comparison-operator> ::= "=" | "<>" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">="

<additive-operator> ::= "+" | "-"

<multiplicative-operator> ::= "*" | "/"
```
This simplified BNF covers basic constructs like blocks (DO...END), assignment statements, conditional statements (IF...THEN...ELSE...END), loops (REPEAT...UNTIL and FOR...DO...END), and arithmetic expressions. You would need to expand the grammar to include other features of Progress ABL, such as database access, procedures and functions, error handling, and more.

It's also worth noting that BNF by itself does not capture all of the semantics and constraints of a language like Progress ABL, so you will need to complement the grammar with additional validation rules and semantic analysis during the parsing and compilation process.



# Parser 

Creating a complete parser for the ABL (Advanced Business Language) is beyond the scope of this response. However, I can provide a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take to implement a parser for ABL, based on the simplified lexer from the previous response.

    Start with the tokens produced by the lexer.

    Implement a recursive descent parser, which is a top-down parsing technique that starts from the top-level grammar rule and works its way down. For each non-terminal symbol in your grammar, you would define a corresponding parsing function.

    In each parsing function, read tokens from the lexer output and determine the appropriate grammar rule to apply based on the current token. If the current token matches the expected terminal symbol, consume the token and continue parsing. If it matches a non-terminal symbol, call the corresponding parsing function to handle that non-terminal symbol.

    As you parse the input, construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the program structure. Create AST nodes for each language construct (e.g., blocks, assignment statements, if statements, loops) and connect them to form a tree structure.

    Handle syntax errors by raising exceptions or reporting errors when encountering unexpected tokens or when reaching the end of input prematurely.

Here's a simplified example of a recursive descent parser for the ABL grammar subset discussed earlier:

``` python

class Parser:
    def __init__(self, tokens):
        self.tokens = tokens
        self.position = 0

    def parse(self):
        return self.parse_statement_list()

    def parse_statement_list(self):
        statements = []
        while self.position < len(self.tokens):
            statements.append(self.parse_statement())
        return statements

    def parse_statement(self):
        token_type, token_value = self.tokens[self.position]

        if token_type == 'DO':
            return self.parse_block()
        elif token_type == 'IF':
            return self.parse_if_statement()
        elif token_type == 'REPEAT':
            return self.parse_repeat_statement()
        elif token_type == 'FOR':
            return self.parse_for_statement()
        elif token_type == 'IDENTIFIER':
            return self.parse_assignment_statement()
        else:
            raise SyntaxError(f"Unexpected token '{token_value}'")

    # Implement other parsing functions for each non-terminal symbol in your grammar,
    # such as parse_block, parse_if_statement, parse_repeat_statement, parse_for_statement,
    # parse_assignment_statement, etc.


# Example usage:
tokens = [
    # Token stream generated by the lexer
]

parser = Parser(tokens)
ast = parser.parse()
``` 

This example only covers the high-level structure of the parser. You would need to implement the actual parsing functions for each non-terminal symbol in your grammar, such as parse_block, parse_if_statement, parse_repeat_statement, parse_for_statement, and parse_assignment_statement. Additionally, you would need to create the appropriate AST nodes and handle error conditions.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example for a subset of ABL features. A complete ABL parser would need to support more language constructs, handle precedence and associativity of operators, and manage error recovery and reporting. Also, consider using parser generator tools like ANTLR or PLY to help with building a more robust parser.
